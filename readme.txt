Instructions On How To Run The Models

1. MATLAB Versions

Please only run the code on versions R2020a or R2020b.

2. Directory and Running the Models

All the necessary test data and trained models for testing are available in the parent directory.

Please only run the following files for testing by just clicking 'Run' in the editor:

testingNaiveBayesModels.m
testingRandomForestModels.m

The 'WineSummaryStats.m' file just has summary statistics and correlation matrix code.

The training code is in the 'Training' folder for review.

3. MATLAB Code Dependencies

This code was written with toolbox and subfunctions. However, to check, you can click on the down
arrow next to 'Current Folder' and go to 'Reports' and 'Dependency Report'.
